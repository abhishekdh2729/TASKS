Here i have uploaded the two tasks related to python.
Task 1: Identifying the different objects using OpenCV, but here i considered only single object detection i.e., person or face.
Task 2: The task is to identify the brightness and contrast of the given image and classifying the brightness as "Overexposed" and "Underexposed" & contrast as "low" and "high".
